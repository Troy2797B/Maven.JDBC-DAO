We are making a Data Access Layer. This allows us to access the information in a database (SQL).

A DAO is a Data Access Object. This object can do CRUD operations. It can CRUD from our table.
A DTO is a Data Transfer Object.
This is a mapping to the table. This class is directly correlating to the table in your database.
Each column is a field, there are getters and setters, and a constructor for the object.
So the DAO acts on the dto which can connect to the table????

DTOClass: this layer should contain a simple class called Data Transfer Object(DTO)
this object is just a simple mapping to the table, every column in the table would
be a member variable in the class. our aim is to order this layer to create, modify,
delete or search for an entity. Using simple java objects rather than dealing
with SQL statements and other database related commands. We want to map this table
to our java code, we can do so by creating a simple class(bean) that contains the same fields.

Now make a constructor: A good practice is to provide default empty constructor, a full constructor and a full constructor without the id parameter.


Now we have to make a connector class. It connects to the database using a URL. There is a specific syntax for JDBC MySql.
